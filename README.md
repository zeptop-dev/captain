# Captain

Unified management panel for [bosun](https://gitlab.com/boyang-hu/bosun)
nodes: users, plans, orders and payments, subscription output, node fleet,
forwarding policy and configuration push. One Go binary with the admin console
and user portal embedded. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Status

Backend skeleton, verified by an end-to-end API test:

- SQLite database with embedded migrations (users, sessions, plans,
  subscriptions, orders, nodes, inbounds, entries, chains, traffic, online
  devices, forward status, settings).
- Admin API: login with argon2id + session cookie, create nodes (one-time
  pairing code), inbounds, users, plans, grant a plan.
- Agent API implementing `bosun/pkg/agentproto`: pair, state with ETag,
  report (traffic charged to the active subscription, online devices,
  forward status, node liveness). A user whose subscription expires or runs
  out of quota disappears from the node's desired state.

Not yet: bosun's Captain driver, subscription renderers, orders and payments
(EPay, Stripe), user portal API, React frontends, jobs.
